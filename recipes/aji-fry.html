            <ol>
                <li>
                    First prepare the horse mackerel. Remove the hard
                    fin from the near the tail toward the belly, and then
                    remove the head. Slit the belly open and rinse well
                    with water having removed the innards.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cut each side of the horse mackerel off the backbone
                    to form two fillets. Remove the remaining inner bones
                    from the fillets by scraping off the stomach area and
                    carefully tweezing them out.
